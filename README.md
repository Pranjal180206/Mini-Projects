# Mini Projects

A folder of small projects I’ve worked on while learning different programming concepts. These are mostly practice projects where I experiment with ideas, try things out, and gradually improve my understanding of core development fundamentals.

## Projects:

- Space Invader – Developed classic 2D arcade-style games using Python library PyGame featuring collision handling, scoring systems, and enemy behavior.
- Iris Dataset Classification – Built a complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, visualization, multiple classifiers, and performance evaluation.
- Cattle vs Buffalo Image Classification System – Designed an end-to-end ML system using YOLOv8 and Flask for image-based animal classification, with confidence scoring, automated SQLite logging, and a prediction history dashboard.
